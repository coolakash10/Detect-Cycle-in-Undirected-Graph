# Detect-Cycle-in-Undirected-Graph
Different ways to detect cycle in undirected graph

In undirected graph we can detect cycle by man ways some of them are:

        1. BFS Traversal
        2. DFS Traversal
        3. Union Find Algorithm
        4. Union Find by Rank and Path Compression Algorithm

The common thing in all algorithm is parent of current node is considered to compare with neighbours of current node. This helps to detect cycle in graph.
